<p>
This is a simple example of Wik markup up. Wik markup
is short and sweet. Never complex, or hard to read.
</p>
<p>
Wik supports some basic inline markup features, like
*strong* and _underscore_ and /emphisis/ and :texttype:.
</p>
<p style="   #000;">
Maybe you need to put a box around a paragraph?              
</p>
<p id="" class="">
Jeez, do we really want all the text to the right?           
Well now really, so we use type, id and class. Then 
stick our stylesheet at the bottom of the document
where no one really cares about it. Have a look.
</p>
<p>
Obvious having to line up the right side of your document
all the time can be a pain. Don't worry. The trick
is to put at least three space between your content
and the :|: line. The let the :wik: command line fix
her all up for you. No problemo.
</p>
<p>
Okay, there are a few other features we need to fill
you on. Wik still supports your usual wikiwiki layout
stuff. Such as preformat sections indicated by indents.
</p>
<pre>
  This is preformated text.                                  
  It will look just like
  Y O U   W R O T E   I T !
</pre>
<p>
The there are the good old bullet lists:
</p>
<ul/ class="" style=" red">
<li/>
* here                                                       
</li/>
</ul/>
<li>
  * here                                                     
</li>
<li>
  * here                                                     
</li>
<li>
    * here                                                   
</li>
<li>
</li>
    * here                                                   
<//li>
</li>
<li>
* here                                                       
</li>
<li>
  * here                                                     
</li>
<li>
</ul>
  * here                                                     
<//ul>
</li>
<p>
And good old numerated lists.
